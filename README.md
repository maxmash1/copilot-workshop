## Project 1: Hello World

**Description:**

This is a simple "Hello World!" project that introduces you to the basics of using GitHub Copilot. With this project, you will test your setup and practice using Copilot to complete simple code and get comfortable with how it suggests functions and snippets.

---

## Project 2: Tic Tac Toe Analyzer (bonus - make it Browser-based)

**Description:**

In this project, you will analyze a java based Tic Tac Toe game. You’ll use Copilot to analyze the code, document what the code does, look for vulnerabilities and then use GH Copilot to convert the project to run in a browser. 

---

## Project 3: Vulnerable Code Analysis and Documentation

**Description:**

This project is focused on analyzing vulnerable code snippets using GitHub Copilot. You will analyze known security vulnerabilities and document the code. Copilot will assist you in identifying potential issues and generating proper documentation for the code.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how Copilot can assist in code review and vulnerability analysis/detection.
- Document insecure code and recommend fixes using Copilot’s suggestions.

---

## Project 4: Contact Book with JSON Persistence

**Description:**

This project involves building a simple contact book application where contact details are stored using a JSON persistence layer. The contact book allows adding, viewing, and removing contacts, and all data is saved in a JSON file for persistence across sessions.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Use Copilot to build a contact management system.
- Understand how to read and write data using JSON for persistent storage.

---

## Project 5: Run-time Analysis Tool

**Description:**

In this project, you will build a run-time analysis tool that measures the performance of functions. The tool will track execution time for specific algorithms. You’ll use GitHub Copilot to build the tool.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Building tools with GitHub Copilot.

---

## Project 6: Translation and Modernization Project

**Description:**

This project focuses on the steps involved, at a high level, of translating legacy code (COBOL) to a modern language. GitHub Copilot will assist in all phases of this project.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Use GitHub Copilot for code modernization

---

## Project 7: ADO to GitHub Actions Translation

**Description:**

In this project, you will interpret and document what an Azure DevOps (ADO) configuration file. Then translate it into a GitHub Actions YAML file. You’ll use GitHub Copilot to confirm the translated GitHub Actions YAML file performs the same tasks.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze an ADO pipeline configuration file.
- Translate the configuration file.
- Validate that the translated GitHub Actions YAML performs the same tasks as the original ADO file.
