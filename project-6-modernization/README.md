# Project 6 - COBOL code modernization

In this project you will use GitHub Copilot to undertake the task of modernizing a COBOL program including the intermediary steps involved.
Specifically, use GitHub Copilot to:
- Explain what the COBOL program is doing
- Create documentation for what the program is doing in markdown format
- Create a Data flow diagram using mermaid.js that can be copied to a GitHub issue and previewed
- Create user stories
- Create a Java/JavaScript or Python program from the user stories
- Translate the COBOL code to Java/JavaScript or Python code
- Create a Data Flow diagram from the converted Java/JavaScript or Python code in mermaid.js that can be copied to a GitHub issue and previewed
