# Project 6 - Code Modernization
## COBOL

In this project you will use GitHub Copilot to undertake the task of modernizing a COBOL program including the intermediary steps involved.
Specifically, use GitHub Copilot to:
- Explain what the COBOL program is doing
- Create documentation for what the program is doing in markdown format
- Create a Data flow diagram using mermaid.js that can be copied to a GitHub issue and previewed
- Create user stories
- Create a Java/JavaScript or Python program from the user stories
- Translate the COBOL code to Java/JavaScript or Python code
- Create a Data Flow diagram from the converted Java/JavaScript or Python code in mermaid.js that can be copied to a GitHub issue and previewed

> [!TIP]
> [Mermaid Chart](https://github.com/marketplace/mermaid-chart) can be used within the IDE using [Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-extensions-to-integrate-external-tools-with-copilot-chat)


## React to Angular
- Clone https://github.com/andrewagain/emoji-search
- Run the application to get an idea of what it does and use Copilot `/explain` in the terminal to assist with any errors.
- Use the following chat prompt before asking Copilot how to transform the code
    - `@workspace /explain`

> [!TIP]
> Attaching a codebase to the prompt gives copilot all of the context of the entire application.
> Copilot may switch between standalone components and NgModule if not given context in each prompt or with a .github/copilot-instructions.md file
