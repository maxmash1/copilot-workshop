# Project 1: "Hello, Copilot!" â€” Introduction to GitHub Copilot

### Use Case: Testing setup and getting familiar with GitHub Copilot's basic functionality, exploring how Copilot assists with common coding tasks, and understanding how to work with its suggestions.

### Objective:
- Introduce the basics of GitHub Copilot by creating a simple "Hello, World!" project in Python.
- Audience will learn how to leverage Copilot's code complete, code suggestions, and refactoring capabilities.
  
### Problem to Solve: 
- Create a Python/JavaScript or Java program that prints "Hello, World!" but adds some personalization by dynamically greeting the user based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).
  
Steps:
1. Create a new Python file called `greeting.py`.
2. Task: Write a script that:
   - Gets the current time.
   - Based on the time, it should greet the user with "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening."
3. Use comments in the file to dictate what you want Copilot to generate.
4. Use the completions panel to get additional results, do they satisfy your use case?
5. Use Copilot Chat:
   - Use GitHub Copilot Chat to prompt Copilot to solve the same problem.
Question: Which method did you prefer?
6. Use Copilot Chat to create a simple unit test for the program. Does it work as expected?
