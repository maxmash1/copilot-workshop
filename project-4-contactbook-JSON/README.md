# Project 4: Contact Book with JSON Persistence

This project involves building a simple contact book application where contact details are stored using a JSON persistence layer. The contact book allows adding, viewing, and removing contacts, and all data is saved in a JSON file for persistence across sessions.

### Learning Objectives:
- Use GH Copilot to build a contact management system.
- Understand how to read and write data using JSON for persistent storage.
