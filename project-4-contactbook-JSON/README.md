# Project 4: Contact Book with JSON Persistence

This project involves building a simple contact book application where contact details are stored using a JSON persistence layer. The contact book allows adding, viewing, and removing contacts, and all data is saved in a JSON file for persistence across sessions.

### Learning Objectives:
- Use GH Copilot to build a contact management system.
- Understand how to read and write data using JSON for persistent storage.

- Write a JavaScript/Python or Java program that allows users to:
  - Add a contact (name, phone number, email).
  - View all contacts.
  - Remove a contact by name (and/or other attribute).
  - Save the contacts to a JSON file, so that they persist across program runs.
  
Steps:
1. Setting up the project: Create a JavaScript/Java or Python file called `contact_book.js or .py or .java`.
  
2. Use GH Copilot to write a script that:
   - Uses a JSON file to store contact data.
   - Implements the ability to add, view, and remove contacts.
   - Handles saving and loading contacts from a JSON file.
  
3. GitHub Copilot Usage:
   - Use either GH Copilot Chat or Code Completions to structure for contact management (e.g., adding contacts), and let Copilot assist in implementing file reading and writing using the `json` module.

4. Generate Unit tests for each function - Do all the functions in the program work correctly?
