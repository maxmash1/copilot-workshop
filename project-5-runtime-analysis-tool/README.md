# Project 5 - Build a runtime analysis tool that analyzes performance of various functions

Example ideas of functions to analyze
Language native - Built-in sort
User implemented - Quick sort, Merge sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort

Steps: Use GitHub Copilot to
- Build a function that generates lists of random integers according to provided input: 10 - 1 million
- List size will be specified by user at run-time
- Range of integer values will be specified by user at run-time
- Run the functions (sorting algorithms) with generated list of integers
- Calculate and display the time it took to run the function
- Allow for multiple runs

Method:
Use GH Copilot to build each step for you
