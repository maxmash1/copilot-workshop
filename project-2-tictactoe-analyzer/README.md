# Project 2: Using GitHub Copilot To modify/fix an existing Tic Tac Toe game

In this workshop, we will focus on using the power of GitHub Copilot to fix issues with an existing project. There is a working Tic Tac Toe game written in Java but it has problems.

As a developer, your goal is to **find and fix the problems**. We recommend the following tasks in order:
- Highlight the program code using #selection to find out if there are any issues with the provided code.
- Use GitHub Copilot to fix the issues.
- Generate unit tests to verify the various functions in the game are working as expected.
- Are you able to refactor and/or optimize the code, any methods?
- Generate documentation based on the code that explains what the program does.

## Optional:
In this optional section of the project, you'll use GitHub Copilot to create a browser version of the Tic Tac Toe game you completed in the first exercise. No order or task list is provided, the goal here is to prompt Copilot Chat to create the JavaScript version of this game and any other necessary files you need to run it in the browser (hint: HTML, CSS). Optionally if you have time you can modify the look of the webpage to make the game interface visually appealing.
